# Chapter 1: Buddhism and Elephants

1.
    1. The Buddha once told the story of the blind men and the elephant (*Udāna 69f.*).
    2. A former king of the town of Sāvatthi, he related, ordered all his blind subjects to be assembled and divided into groups.
    3. Each group was then taken to an elephant and introduced to a different part of the animal — the head, trunk, legs, tail, and so forth.
    4. Afterwards, the king asked each group to describe the nature of the beast.
    5. Those who had made contact with the head described an elephant as a water-pot; those familiar with the ears likened the animal to a winnowingbasket; those who had touched a leg said an elephant was like a post, and those who had felt a tusk insisted an elephant was shaped like a peg.
    6. The groups then fell to arguing amongst themselves each insisting its definition was correct and all the others were wrong.

2.
    1. The study of Buddhism over the past century or so has resembled the encounter of the blind men and the elephant in many ways.
    2. Students of Buddhism have tended to fastern onto a small part of the tradition and assume their conclusions held true about the whole.
    3. Often the parts they have seized on have been a little like the elephant's tusks — a striking, but unrepresentative, part of the whole animal.
    4. As a result, many erroneous and sweeping generalizations about Buddhism have been made, such as that it is 'negative', 'world-denying', 'pessimistic', and so forth.
    5. Although this tendency to over-generalize is now less common, it is still found in some of the older literature where authors tended to exaggerate certain features of the tradition or assume that what was true of Buddhism in one culture or historical period held good everywhere.

3.
    1. The first lesson the story of the blind men teaches us, then, is that Buddhism is a large and complex subject, and we should be wary of generalizations made on the basis of familiarity with any single part.
    2. In particular, statements which begin 'Buddhists believe . . .' or 'Buddhism teaches . . .' must be treated with circumspection.
    3. We need to qualify them by asking ***which*** Buddhists are being referred to, ***which*** tradition of Buddhism they follow, ***which*** school or sect they belong to, and so forth, before these statements can be of much value.
    4. Some scholars would go further, and claim that the transcultural phenomenon known to the West as 'Buddhism' (the word 'Buddhism' only became established in Western usage in the 1830s) is not a single entity at all but a collection of subtraditions.
    5. If so, perhaps we should speak of 'Buddhisms' (plural) rather than 'Buddhism' (singular).
    6. The tendency to 'deconstruct' Buddhism in this way, however, is probably best seen as a reaction to the earlier tendency to 'essentialize' it, in other words to assume that Buddhism was a monolithic institution which was everywhere the same.
    7. The middle way here is to think of Buddhism as resembling the elephant in the story: it has a curious assembly of somewhat unlikely parts but also a central bulk to which they are attached.

4.
    1. A second lesson we might learn from the story — one less obvious but no less important — is that there are many kinds of blindness.
    2. Experiments in visual perception have shown that the mind has a great influence on what we see.
    3. To a large extent human beings see what they expect — or want — to see, and screen out material which does not fit their model of reality.
    4. In different cultures children are brought up to see and understand in different ways, which is why alien customs often seem curious or strange to outsiders but quite natural to members of the culture concerned.
    5. When dealing with other cultures, it is easy to project our own beliefs and values and then magically 'discover' them in the source material.
    6. Buddhism thus becomes exactly what we hoped (or feared) it would be.
    7. Even experts are not immune from anachronistically 'reading back' their own assumptions into the data, and many Western scholars have interpreted Buddhism in ways which clearly owe more to their own personal beliefs and upbringing than to Buddhism itself.

5.
    1. Apart from the susceptibility of individual perceptions to subjective infleunces of various kinds, there is also the risk of cultural stereotyping which arises in any encounter with 'the other'.
    2. Contemporary writers said as Edward Said have drawn attention to the West's tendency to construct in its art and literature an 'Orient' which is more a refelection of its own shadow-side than an accurate depiction of what is really there.
    3. There is no need to accept Said's elaborate conspiracy theory to the effect that the West stereotyped the Orient intellectually to colonizing it politcally to realize that in approaching the study of other cultures we cannot help but be influenced by residual attitudes and assumptions within our own culture of which we are barely conscious.
    4. In connection with the study of Buddhism, then, we must be alert to the risk of 'cultureblindness', and the misunderstandings which can arise from the assumption that Western categories and concepts apply to other cultures and civilizations.
