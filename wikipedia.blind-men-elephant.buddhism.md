    1. Buddha twice uses the simile of blind men led astray.
    2. The earliest known version occurs in the text *Udana 6.4*.

    1. In the *Canki Sutta* he describes a row of blind men holding on to each other as an example of those who follow an old text that has passed down from generation to generation.
    2. In the Udana (68-69) he uses the elephant parable to describe sectarian quarrels.
    3. A king has the blind men of the capital brought to the palace, where an elephant is brought in and they are asked to describe it.

> When the blind men had each felt a part of the elephant, the king went to each of them and said to each: "Well, blind man, have you seen the elephant? Tell me, what sort of thing is an elephant?"

    1. The men assert the elephant is either like a pot (the blind man who felt the elephant's head), a winnowing basket (ear), a plowshare (tusk), a plow (trunk), a granary (body), a pillar (foot), a mortar (back), a pestle (tail) or a brush (tip of the tail).

    1. The men cannot agree with one another and come to blows over the question of what it is like and their dispute delights the king.
    2. The Buddha ends the story by comparing the blind men to preachers and scholars who are blind and ignorant and hold their own views: "Just so are these preachers and scholars holding various views blind and unseeing.... In their ignorance they are by nature quarrelsome, wrangling, and disputatious, each maintaining reality is thus and thus."
    3. The Buddha then speaks the following verse:

> O how they cling and wrangle, some who claim
> For preacher and monk the honored name!
> For, quarreling, each to his view they cling.
> Such folk see only one side of a thing.
